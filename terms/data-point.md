# Data point

Data point is a single fact or piece of information. In the context of **building management systems** \(BMS\) data often is gathered with various types of sensors. In the data product context each sensor is a data point source \(device in ontology\). 

**Each device is not a data product.** Data product contains [payload](payload.md) which is a collection of data points. Of course there is possible situation that building includes just one CO2 measuring device and the data points of that device constitute [data product payload](payload.md).
