# Quality

Quality covers properties which describe qualitative parameters related to either product or services. If qualitative parameters can be monitored, it is possible to set target value ranges for the quality properties, and SLA clauses can be formulated into contracts between a data publisher and a customer. Product can contain these SLA options \(product conditions\) or they can be agreed in a contract between a publisher and a customer. The possible actions caused by breaching SLA clauses are also agreed in the contract. It is possible for a seller to define them as part of product conditions, and then they are non-negotiable on contract level.
