# Condition

Condition covers properties related product limitations which describe how a product can be used. For example, whether a product can be resold further, or for what purposes the product can be used, and by whom. Conditions can be divided in non-negotiable product conditions, and negotiable contract conditions. It is up to a data publisher to decide how the conditions are negotiated, and which of them negotiable. It is possible to set all contract conditions as non-negotiable, that means the product is offered in “take it or leave it” principle.
