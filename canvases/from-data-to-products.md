# From data to products

Lean Canvas is a 1-page business plan template created by Ash Maurya that helps you deconstruct your idea into its key assumptions. It is adapted from Alex Osterwalder's Business Model Canvas and optimized for Lean Startups. It replaces elaborate business plans with a single page business model.

Business plans take **too long to write, are seldom updated, and almost never read** by others but documenting your hypotheses is key.

We apply the same thinking in data product development. We are building canvas tools which enables any data owner to productize data to data products. With help of the canvases anyone can iterate and evaluate data product ideas to find out for whom the product is for, what it costs to build and maintain, how to reach target groups and such.
